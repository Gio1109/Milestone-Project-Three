# Milestone-Project-Three
Final Project for Full Stack certification


Milestone Project 3, working title "Iron Roster", is a campaign and unit lore app that users can log into and have CRUD functionality over units in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. For developmental purposes, the current version is restricted for now to the Iron Warriors faction specifically. 

Specifically, once past a server-side authenticated login page, users will be able to view their and other user's armies, the units within those armies, and be able to edit their own contributions. User info will be stored securely server-side, while local info will be kept client side. For dev purposes, images and other info will be pre-sourced, but once deployed eventual functionality would include user ability to submit/use uploaded images. 


"Stretch" goals of functionality once these basic measurements are met include a dynamic timeline/map that allows users to submit battles or notable events their armies and units took part in. 


Much of the coding done during this project will be made using instructions and past work done during the Full Stack certification course, and proper attribution will be made for lessons or repos used as examples and inspiration.


Specific pages/views needed so far are:

login/authentication page
home page
search page
army view page
unit view page
CRUD pages for units and armies
